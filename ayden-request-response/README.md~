## Ayden Request Repsonse Demo
This is a simple app which integration of a 3rd party website that supports two posts and two requests that echo the data that was posted.  It is inspired from the documentation found here:

#### What you will build
You will build a service that requests customer information from a CloudFoundry hosted Customer Search service and caches them in PCC. You will then see that fetching the same customer information again eliminates the expensive call to retrieve customer information from MySQL.

The Ayden Request Response service has the following APIs:

`- GET /capture`          - get authorizations that have been captured
`- GET /authorize`         - get authorizations stored in the embedded database on the server side
`- curl -d "@authorize.txt" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/authorize
`- curl -d "@capture-payment.txt" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/capture
  
#### What you will need
